# Keystone Comprehensive Improvement Plan

**Goal:** Make Kiyota Keystone the simplest identity platform for beginners and the most capable platform for advanced users — while staying secure, fast, and mobile-friendly.

**Principles:**
- *Progressive disclosure* — show only what is needed, never hide the path to more control.
- *Secure by default* — every feature ships with safe defaults.
- *Mobile-first* — every screen must be usable on a phone.
- *API-first* — every UI action is backed by a documented, automatable API.

## 1. Mobile Responsiveness & Accessibility

### 1.1 Complete responsive audit
Audit every panel and fix overflow, truncation, and unreachable controls on screens < 640 px.

Priority files:
- `frontend/src/components/ApplicationsPanel.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/OrganizationsPanel.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/EnterpriseSsoPanel.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/WorkflowPanel.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/BillingPanel.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/ui/DataTable.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/wizard/SimpleWizard.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/wizard/Wizard.tsx`

Concrete rules:
- All button groups use `flex-col sm:flex-row` and `w-full sm:w-auto`.
- All tables become horizontal-scroll cards on mobile or switch to a stacked row layout.
- Forms use full-width inputs with labels above.
- Modals/dialogs become bottom sheets on mobile.

### 1.2 Mobile navigation redesign
Replace the desktop sidebar with a responsive pattern:
- Desktop: collapsible sidebar.
- Tablet: icon-only rail.
- Mobile: bottom tab bar for top-level sections plus a hamburger menu for the rest.

Files to update:
- `frontend/src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/layout/MobileNav.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/layout/AppShell.tsx`

### 1.3 Touch-friendly components
- Minimum tap target 44 × 44 px.
- Larger checkboxes, toggles, and select controls on mobile.
- Pull-to-refresh on data tables.
- Swipe gestures on cards (e.g., delete with confirmation).

### 1.4 Accessibility (a11y)
- Add `aria-label`, `aria-describedby`, and `role` attributes to all icon buttons.
- Ensure focus order is logical in modals and wizards.
- Add keyboard shortcuts documentation panel.
- Run automated a11y checks with `axe-core` in CI.
- Support reduced-motion preferences.

## 2. Security Hardening

### 2.1 Session security
- Enforce `SameSite=strict` for cookies in production unless cross-origin login is explicitly enabled.
- Add session binding to IP + user-agent fingerprint with optional strict mode.
- Implement idle timeout and absolute session lifetime with configurable defaults (30 min idle, 7 days absolute).
- Add concurrent session limits per user.

### 2.2 Authentication hardening
- Enable password breach detection via Have I Been Pwned (or self-hosted `hibp` service) by default.
- Add account lockout after failed attempts with exponential backoff.
- Require email verification before owner/admin actions.
- Add device trust: prompt for MFA when a new device is detected.

### 2.3 API and token security
- Rotate JWT signing keys automatically on a schedule (daily check, rotate if older than 90 days).
- Add key version metadata to the JWKS endpoint.
- Enforce strict audience (`aud`) and issuer (`iss`) validation.
- Scope API keys to organizations and applications with fine-grained permissions.
- Add API key usage quotas and expiration warnings.
- Implement signed webhook payloads so consumers can verify authenticity.

### 2.4 Secrets provider hardening
- Default to `EnvironmentSecretsProvider` in production instead of `DatabaseSecretsProvider`.
- Add built-in providers for AWS KMS, HashiCorp Vault, Azure Key Vault, and Google Cloud KMS.
- Encrypt all secrets at rest with AES-256-GCM.
- Audit every secret read/write/rotate event.

### 2.5 Audit and compliance
- Make audit logs tamper-evident with a hash chain or append-only stream.
- Add export formats: CSV, JSON, NDJSON, and CEF for SIEMs.
- Add retention policies and automatic archiving.
- Add GDPR-style data export and deletion workflows.

## 3. Backend Architecture Improvements

### 3.1 Domain service consolidation
Create explicit orchestration services to reduce coupling:
- `AuthenticationApplicationService`
- `AuthorizationApplicationService`
- `IdentityApplicationService`
- `OrganizationApplicationService`
- `SetupApplicationService`

Move ad-hoc orchestration out of route files and thin services into these application services.

### 3.2 Background job queue productionization
- Default to BullMQ when Redis is available; keep in-process queue for local dev.
- Add job retries with exponential backoff and dead-letter queues.
- Add a jobs dashboard UI to inspect/retry failed jobs.
- Queue categories: emails, webhooks, analytics, workflows, exports.

### 3.3 Plugin architecture GA
- Stabilize the plugin manifest format.
- Add hot-reload for plugins in development.
- Add plugin marketplace UI (list installed, enable/disable, configure).
- Provide official plugin templates for identity providers, email providers, and workflow steps.

### 3.4 Configuration management
- Complete the `ConfigStore` abstraction (`EnvFileConfigStore`, `JsonConfigStore`, `KubernetesSecretConfigStore`, `VaultConfigStore`).
- Add configuration profiles: Development, Production, Docker, Docker Compose, Kubernetes, High Availability.
- Add configuration validation with actionable error messages.
- Add dry-run mode and automatic backup before writes.

### 3.5 Database and migrations
- Add migration status endpoint and UI.
- Add zero-downtime migration strategy documentation.
- Add connection pooling metrics.
- Support read replicas for analytics queries.

### 3.6 Observability
- Add structured health checks with dependency details.
- Add OpenTelemetry tracing (optional, disabled by default).
- Add metrics endpoint (`/metrics`) for Prometheus.
- Add structured logging conventions across all services.

## 4. New User-Facing Features

### 4.1 Smart Setup Wizard 2.0
Make first-run setup fully UI-driven with no file editing required.

Steps:
1. **Welcome & profile** — pick environment, auto-fill defaults.
2. **Dependencies** — detect or install PostgreSQL/Redis via Docker, test connections.
3. **URLs & security** — suggest public URLs, generate secrets, set CORS origins.
4. **Owner account** — create first admin with password strength meter.
5. **First application** — ask for project URL/framework, auto-create org + app.
6. **Done** — show one-line drop-in script and "Test login" button.

Add to wizard:
- Configuration change summary before apply.
- Automatic configuration backup.

## Notes

- Keep all existing public APIs backward-compatible.
- Introduce feature flags for every major UI change so they can be rolled out gradually.
- Maintain dark mode and theme consistency.
- Update `docs/SECURITY.md`, `docs/PERFORMANCE.md`, and `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` as features land.
